##### Victoria O., Epicodus - December 7, 2018

## Description
Capstone is the final project for Epicodus' program. It will be a [rebuild of a website](https://atthepeakcafe.weebly.com/) for a small, local business in the Seattle area.

This is a work in process - there will be aspects of this page that are non-functioning as it continues being built out.

As of 12/07/18, the focus has been on:
* Working with the client to determine:
    * What they are looking for (what does _*done*_ look like to the clients)?
    * What problems are they looking to solve?
* Creating a mock to:
    * Storyboard
    * Separate the application into components and determine heirarchy
    * Concretely determine what the MVP will be, based on project timeline.
    * Re-evaluate what technologies or tools might be used to most effectively build project out for completion now and for future features.
